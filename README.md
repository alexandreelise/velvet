> Realtime video processing purely in javascript as a side project to learn javascript seriously

This project started on April 26th 2022.

## Story

Starting a side project called Velvet. today as a challenge to force me to learn javascript more seriously. Who said Kyle Simpson?  It's a simple realtime video processing app using only javascript to process image raw data coming from the webcam. Today, only the grayscale filter has been implemented. And no, it's not to do an Instagram copycat or  anything like that. It's more to learn to take a deep breath and dive in the realm of the true power of javascript that I have learn to hate until today. Seeing that project alive in a couple of hours made me rethink of what it is to learn it seriously , read all Kyle's book again and again. Try in some projects like that one. My goal with this project is to do basic object detection. Again It's to learn how it works, not to compete with PhD and other really smart people around this are like  Meor Amer with his cool new book on Learning Visually Deep Learning (hope I get that one right) If not sorry Meor.

I'll share my progress as it is a side project to learn, and it might be useful for everyone interested.
